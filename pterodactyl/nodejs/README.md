# Node.js egg (14.x and 16.x)

Custom Node.js pterodactyl eggs and images for 14.x and 16.x. **Note: These do not run on Debian, these are Alpine images.**

## Compatibility
This Node.js egg is compatible with Node 14 and 16, and has been custom-fitted to support most Node packages including Discord.js and Canvas (as those are known to be tricky to run by default).
