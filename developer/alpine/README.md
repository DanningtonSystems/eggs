# Alpine OCI developer images

Alpine Linux developer images made by DanningtonSystems. Pre-loaded with zsh, bash, many useful build tools like make and GCC, developer tools like Git, and other utilities. Perfect for developing with dockerised/containerised Alpine Linux, or for testing Alpine Linux in an OCI container.

**NOTE: These Alpine OCI images are __NOT__ meant to be lightweight. These include debugging and other developer tools, along with other utilities that are not needed in production.** If you are looking for lightweight OCI images for Alpine Linux, please see the official [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) Alpine image; alternatively, see the other OCI images and Pterodactyl eggs in this repository. This repository may contain an image that could fit your usecase.
